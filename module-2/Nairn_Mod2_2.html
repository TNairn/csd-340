			<h1>Assignment 2.3 â€“ Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
			<h2>Chapter 1: All About Me</h2>
			<p class="intro">I was born in West Palm Beach, Florida,
				and lived in Lake Worth until I was 7 years old. 
				<span class="sentence">Then, I moved to Cape Coral, 
				Florida where I lived for the rest of my adolescent years.</span> 
				After high school I moved to the Denver area of 
				Colorado, but I still consider Cape Coral to be my hometown.</p>
			<p>My childhood was pretty typical. I spent a lot of time 
				playing with my friends in the neighborhood, and I stayed 
				out of trouble for the most part. My parents encouraged 
				me to get good grades in school, and I did okay at that.</p>
			<p>My hobbies have had some variation throughout the years, 
				but music has always been a part of my life. I was in band 
				all through grade school, and I have played guitar since I was 4.
				In middle school I picked up electronic music production and I 
				still enjoy both guitar and producing as a hobby. Video games 
				have also been a hobby of mine, and since moving to Colorado I 
				have developed a love for downhill skiing.</p>
			<p>I have a few family members that live in different parts of 
				the United States, but most of my extended family lives in Florida. 
				Most of the family members I have a relationship with come from 
				my dad's side and spending time with them around the holiday season 
				was always important. Since moving to Colorado 6 years ago, it has 
				been more difficult to see them, but I still make the time to visit.</p>
